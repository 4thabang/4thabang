### ðŸ‘‹ About Me:

My name is Thabang. I am a founder currently working on lower level infrastructure technology in the machine learning operations (MLOps) space.

### ðŸš€ Working On:
I am currently working on [_**deploi.ai**_](https://deploi.ai).<br/><br/>
We are building infrastructure for teams to effortlessly `deploy`, `test`, and `monitor` their machine learning and deep learning models in collaborative staging environments in order to validate model accuracy, eradicate data bias, reduce model drift and train alongside real-world data, all before deploying a model into production.
<br/><br/>
If you are interested in changing the advent of machine learning alongside a dedicated team of young visionaries, [get in touch](mailto:thabang@fordabl.com)!

### ðŸŒ„ Our Mission:
Our mission is to aid progress toward faultless ML & DL models for a safer and more autonomous future by starting at the infrastructure level.
